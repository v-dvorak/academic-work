## [Ruskey-Savage Conjecture](https://github.com/v-dvorak/ruskey-savage-conjecture) (Haskell, 🇬🇧, 2024)

- final project for Non-procedural programming course
- proposed in 1993, this conjecture states that every pairing in an n-dimensional hypercube graph can be extended to a Hamiltonian cycle
- to prove the conjecture for a specific dimension, the program generates the hypercube, finds all possible matchings, and checks if they can be extended to Hamiltonian cycles
